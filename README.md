FCC Tribute page to Marcus Furius Camillus - Second Founder of Rome

This project is for FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification. It is the first project. I worked in Visual Studio and published here to bypass using Codepen. An earlier (and much uglier!) version of this project was done in Code Pen but I felt this would be better representative of actual work.
